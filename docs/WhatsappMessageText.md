# WhatsappMessageText

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Body** | **string** | Required for text messages. The text of the text message which can contain URLs which begin with http:// or https:// and formatting. See available formatting options here. If you include URLs in your text and want to include a preview box in text messages (preview_url: true), make sure the URL starts with http:// or https:// â€” https:// URLs are preferred. You must include a hostname, since IP addresses will not be matched. Maximum length: 4096 characters. | 
**PreviewUrl** | Pointer to **bool** | By default, WhatsApp recognizes URLs and makes them clickable, but you can also include a preview box with more information about the link. Set this field to true if you want to include a URL preview box. The majority of the time, the receiver will see a URL they can click on when you send an URL, set preview_url to true, and provide a body object with a http or https link. URL previews are only rendered after one of the following has happened: - The business has sent a message template to the user. - The user initiates a conversation with a \&quot;click to chat\&quot; link. - The user adds the business phone number to their address book and initiates a conversation. Default: &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional]
